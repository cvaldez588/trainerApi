Patter Design:
-------------
- I used DAO pattern, where TrainerService will be used for Business Logic and TrainerRepository for Data Access.
 
Improvements to be consider in the future:
-----------------------------------------
- Complete TrainerServiceImpl.getTrainerById_success() Unit Test and adding new ones for TrainerRespository class.
- Replace memory DB H2 for a persistent one.
- Improve Trainer Model with more information and validations.
- Create a config file different from lower and production environments.
- Add JSON Based Token validation.
